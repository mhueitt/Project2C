Scientific Question - How does antiviral drugs specifically statins play a role in the outcome and mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2?
Hypothesis -  Hence, if recent studies suggested that statin therapy in COVID-19 patients indicated  a better outcome and a lower risk of mortality then statins can bind to multiple target proteins in SARS-CoV-2 which can contribute to the antiviral efficacy of the drug.

The following files are necessary to complete this code:

1. The R notebook
2. The fasta files for the SPIKE Protein. [SPIKEprotein.fasta.gz]
(https://github.com/mhueitt/Project2C/files/8811381/SPIKEprotein.fasta.gz)
* I obtained the data for SPIKE protein from UNIPROT. The fasta file includes the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 as well as the spike protein related to other coronaviruses from other species such as SARS-CoV, MHV-A59, and HCoV-OC43.
3. The pdb file for the SPIKE Protein which was obtained from the Protein Bank Database.
